<h1> Node JS Project </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2> 
<p> 1. I am Olumide E. Adeola , and  am a budding Physician. My idiosyncracy is to choose the professions and hobbies you love most in life <br/>
2. This are my codes based on NodeJS and it features my codes from simple to advanced . But the unique thing is that I have tried to provide adequate organization, documentation and necessary code explanations <br/>
3. I look forward to collaboration and Job opportunities , and I believe you won't regret our connection <br/>
4. My codes and nature are solution oriented towards problems. Hence I often take the same thought process of imagination, getting an idea and then developing codes that are specifically designed to solve problems <br/>
I invite you to join me in this ride

<h3> Folders Structure </h3>
<dl>
<dt> Basic folder </dt>
<dd>
<li> Contains codes that were written when I was starting out with NodeJS</li>
<li> For instance here we have files such as event.js  </li>
<li> event.js file for event driven codes </li>
<li> mail.js file contains codes that help with handling email </li>
<li> mysqlconnect.js deal with the codes to connect Node.Js to the MySQL database </li>
<li> tutorial.js file deals with codes in order of difficulty when I started out with Node.JS. <br/>
Moreso it contains codes that may look the same, but are intentionally re-written in order to see various ways in which a code can be written </li>
<li> uploadingfiles.js file contains codes to do a simple upload of files </li>

</dd>
<br/>
<dt> Views Folder </dt>
<dd>
<li> In NodeJS application, an ejs templating engine helps to render html files with javascript codes wrapped in it , just as Blade is to Laravel , and Django template engine is to Django </li>
<li> So all ejs files are contained in the views folder and appropriating routing are done in the various servers to get any of these files , or write into them dynamically </li>

</dd>
<br/>
<dt> family folder  </dt>
<dd>
<li> Files include family_connect.js, family.html etc </li>
<li> It utilizes the power of express to control the routing, and also files which can often be html file or even json </li>

</dd>
<br/>
    <dt> Folder Name : node_modules </dt>
    <dd>
    This folder is a common one in programming, It contains the contents of the different packages utilized in the project as folders nested in one another. Just as most operating systems are codes organized in folders , so is node_modules: Different packages with their codes nested in folders and files.
    </dd>
<br/>
<dt> File name : package.json

<dd>
This file is used to define the metadata about a Node.js project, such as its name,version,dependencies, and scripts for running various tasks. It is essential for manageing project configuration and dependencies 
</dd>
<br/>
<dt> package.lock.json </dt>
<dd> This file is automaticaly generated by npm (Node Package Manager) and serves as a record of the exact versions of all dependies installed in your project. It helps ensure consistency in dependencies across different environments and among team members </dd>
